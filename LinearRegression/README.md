## Linear Regression
This file creates a regression dataset using sklearn for 100 samples.  
A gradient descent function is created to manually compute the gradient for the data and output is predicted using this.  
The actual output and predicted line fit is plotted.  
The loss over the number of iterations is also plotted.
